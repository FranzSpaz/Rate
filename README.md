# Purpose

Rate is a library to help you promote your iPhone apps by prompting users to rate the app after using it for a few days. This approach is one of the best ways to get positive app reviews by targeting only regular users (who presumably like the app or they wouldn't keep using it!).

# Supported OS 

Supported build target - iOS 9.0  (Xcode 7.3.1)
